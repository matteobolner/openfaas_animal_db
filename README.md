# openfaas_animal_db
Repository for the OpenFaas function that generates a nucleotide database containing all available reads for the chosen animal downloaded from ENA, and some statistics to better analyze it.

At the moment i am not able to use the python requests module from inside the function, returning 502 bad gateway error
